## Description
Implement an automated release process using GitHub Actions to streamline the package release workflow. This will ensure consistent and reliable releases while reducing manual intervention.

## Current Behavior
- Manual version bumping
- Manual changelog updates
- Manual PyPI publishing
- No automated release validation

## Proposed Solution
Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that will:

1. **Version Management**
   - Automatically detect version changes in pyproject.toml
   - Support semantic versioning (major, minor, patch)
   - Create version tags automatically

2. **Changelog Generation**
   - Automatically generate CHANGELOG.md entries from commit messages
   - Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)
   - Link to relevant PRs and issues

3. **Release Process**
   - Create GitHub releases automatically
   - Build and publish to PyPI
   - Generate release notes
   - Validate package installation

4. **Quality Checks**
   - Run tests before release
   - Check code quality
   - Verify documentation
   - Validate package metadata

## Implementation Steps
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow file
2. Set up version detection and bumping
3. Implement changelog generation
4. Configure PyPI publishing
5. Add release validation steps
6. Document the release process

## Required Changes
- Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Update `pyproject.toml` for version management
- Add release documentation
- Configure PyPI secrets in repository

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated version bumping works correctly
- [ ] Changelog is generated automatically
- [ ] Releases are created on GitHub
- [ ] Package is published to PyPI
- [ ] All quality checks pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Process is documented for contributors

## Additional Context
This automation will help maintain consistent releases and reduce the chance of human error in the release process.

## Dependencies
- GitHub Actions
- PyPI account and token
- Poetry for package management
